        <p className="text-xl md:text-3xl font-light italic pb-4 text-gray-600">Taylor Page stepped up to the plate when my team was maxed out big time! My client had 2 very specific coding requests for their Shopify store and within no time Taylor assessed the requirements and implemented a solution with no hesitation. He was able to explain the solution to me in a way which my non-technical-founder-mind could easily grasp. I will continue to utilize Taylor's development skills for Shopify projects going forward because of his familiarity with the platform and his sharp coding skills. If you're looking for a web developer for any platform, you NEED to touch base with Taylor first.</p>

        <p className="text-xl md:text-3xl font-light italic pb-4 text-gray-600">We were needing help starting our first Shopify site (Navigation, Apps, Coding, Layout) and Taylor reached out to my request. Right away, I knew we wanted to work with Taylor. First off, he did a nice video introduction regarding my initial questions that we had with precise and easy to understand answers. Once we connected, Taylor setup a zoom meeting to get a better idea of what we were looking for. He was very friendly and very helpful and assured us of what his skills were and what he knew how to do. After our first meeting, I felt very confident in hiring Taylor for our project. During the entire process, Taylor was very accommodating (we had many little things pop up that he was quick to address) and had great communication. We really liked that he was eager to dive into our project and was always open to having a video conference to better understand what we needed. He also understood our vision, by asking us questions and getting a better understanding of out point of view, which we really appreciated! All in all, we are extremely happy that we went with Taylor and we highly recommend his services!</p>

        <p className="text-xl md:text-3xl font-light italic pb-4 text-gray-600">Taylor is extremely reliable and went above and beyond. He was readily available and took calls throughout the project to ensure we had all of the information we needed and that all of our needs were being addressed. He often provided personalized video instructions to questions asked - a nice and helpful touch. His work is impeccable. I highly recommend others hire.</p>

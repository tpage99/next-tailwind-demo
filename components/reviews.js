        <p className="font-light italic">Taylor Page stepped up to the plate when my team was maxed out big time! My client had 2 very specific coding requests for their Shopify store and within no time Taylor assessed the requirements and implemented a solution with no hesitation. He was able to explain the solution to me in a way which my non-technical-founder-mind could easily grasp. I will continue to utilize Taylor's development skills for Shopify projects going forward because of his familiarity with the platform and his sharp coding skills. If you're looking for a web developer for any platform, you NEED to touch base with Taylor first.</p>

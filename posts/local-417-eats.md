Local 417 Eats is a project I took on to help promote local restaurants in the Springfield area during the Covid-19 pandemic. After small stimuluses were passed and it seemed that large businesses were taking over available funding, it became clear that small local restaurants needed some additional support. I had seen several people sharing large lists online through spreadsheets and thought that providing this information in the format of an app could help.  

I used the information from the spreadsheets and dropped in a Google Form to provide an opportunity for updates. Because this was a Gatsby app it could be downloaded and information accessed even without data service. I got to integrate the Google Maps API here, which would not be available in the event of no data access but restaurant contact information would be available.

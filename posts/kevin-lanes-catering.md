When my friend Kevin was just starting to pick up more catering gigs for his private in-home chef dining experience, he needed a website. Built with just plain ole HTML, CSS, and Javascript (and design assist from Bootstrap) this rock-solid site needs no maintenance or overhead and serves him just fine. 

One of the biggest special features with this site includes a Facebook Messenger chat button directly on the site. Kevin gets most of his referrals through social media and communicates with many of his clients this way. Dropping a chat button directly onto his website helped make him that much more accessible to his potential customers.

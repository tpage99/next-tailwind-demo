This was an exciting project because it's a greenfield project. This nonprofit is opening a coffee shop in March 2021 and they will be providing jobs for individuals with disabilities. They needed everything from getting their website up and running to figuring out how to take payments in online, and they did not know where to start. I researched multiple payment gateways and providers and we settled on Gravity Payments. Because of this, it limited our ability to go with certain ecommerce solutions and we chose Ecwid because it worked well for the situation. It also gave me an opportunity to try out a JAMstack tool I had been eyeing for some time - Eleventy.

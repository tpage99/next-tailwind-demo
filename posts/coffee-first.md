Coffee First is a static website project to demonstrate how easy it is to accept payments online through a website, outside of using some sort of already pre-built plugin like Woocommerce with Wordpress or a hosted solution like Shopify or Square. Technically, this _does_ use a plugin, but it's a node plugin through the Gatsby ecosystem that pulls existing products in your Stripe Dashboard. Pretty neat, huh? 

Ideally for a setup like this, all you'd need is a Stripe login and swap out some API keys. Not to mention get a better looking and more polished set of landing pages and necessary legal statements. 

You can check out the Coffee First live website by visiting https://coffeefirst.netlify.app/.

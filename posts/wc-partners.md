WC Partners is the social services agency I work for. I left my job as a supervisor at another social work agency to work here, with the promise that I could work on other technology-based skills and advance myself in this way. I was tasked by the Executive Director to build the website and was given creative control over how to make that happen. 

I enjoy working with Gatsby and chose it for this project. The unique bonus Gatsby has is that it makes it easy to turn any Gatsby website into a Progress Web App. This is particularly helpful, as the agency is located in a rural area and individuals may not always have phone service. But with a light-weight app downloaded to their phone, they would be able to review resource information and contact information for necessary people and organizations - even if their phone cannot connect to data.
